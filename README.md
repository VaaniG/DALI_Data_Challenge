# DALI_Data_Challenge

I created three different graphs that compared the product category with sales, the state with sales, and the monthly profits over the course of 4 years (2014 to 2017). From the graph with product category with sales, I noted trends, such as that technology products had the most sales in 3 out of 4 of the years. With the state sales graph, I noticed that California and New York had the two largest sales values. For the profits graph, I noticed that the year 2017 had the most profits, and that there were significant spikes in profits in the years 2016 and 2017 during March and October. 

I also ran a linear fit on the data to calculate profits using a least squares solution. However, the mean square error when I ran my solution on the testing data was extremely high, indicating that a non-linear fit is required or that different feature functions are needed. 

Future Steps: Given the trends I noticed on the graph, I would run statistical tests, such as t-tests, to check for significant correlation between product category and sales, as well as state and sales. I would also try different non-linear fits on the data that would minimize the mean square error.
